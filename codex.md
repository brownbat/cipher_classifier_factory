# Data Pipeline Repair: Resolution Log

## 1. Problem Identification

### 1.1 Core Issue
We identified a critical issue in the data generation pipeline, causing failures in the model training process:
- Missing functions in `prep_samples.py`: `load_books()` and `sample_text()`
- Circular import dependency between core modules

### 1.2 Module Relationships
The data pipeline has a specific flow with distinct responsibilities:
- `researcher.py`: Entry point and orchestration
- `models/common/data.py`: PyTorch integration layer
- `prep_samples.py`: Core data generation and caching
- `book_processing.py`: Text source management

### 1.3 Import Cycle
We identified a circular import dependency:
1. `researcher.py` → imports from `models/__init__.py`
2. `models/__init__.py` → imports from `models/common/data.py`
3. `models/common/data.py` → imports `prep_samples.py`
4. `prep_samples.py` → imported `shutdown_event` from `researcher.py`

## 2. Resolution Process

### 2.1 Environment Setup
- Identified project-specific virtual environment in `.venv/`
- Verified `torch-lr-finder` dependency (essential for transformer training)
- Ensured proper path resolution for imports

### 2.2 Implementation of Missing Functions
Added the following functions to `prep_samples.py`:
```python
def load_books(dir_path):
    """Loads text files from specified directory"""
    # Implementation loads processed book files

def sample_text(book_texts, length):
    """Samples text of specified length from books"""
    # Implementation with fallback to get_random_text_passage

def list_cipher_names():
    """Compatibility alias for _get_cipher_names()"""
    return _get_cipher_names()
```

### 2.3 Breaking the Circular Import
Modified how `prep_samples.py` gets the shutdown event:
1. Removed direct import of `shutdown_event` from researcher.py
2. Created a local Event instance in prep_samples.py
3. Added code in researcher.py to explicitly set prep_samples.shutdown_event at runtime

### 2.4 Module Documentation
Updated CLAUDE.md with:
- Virtual environment details
- Dependency information
- Import structure guidelines
- Data pipeline architecture

## 3. Testing and Verification

### 3.1 Import Testing
Successfully verified:
- `import prep_samples` - Passes
- `from models.common import data` - Passes

### 3.2 Full System Testing
- Command-line help for researcher.py works properly
- Module import paths correctly resolve
- Shutdown event successfully shared between modules

## 4. Architectural Notes

### 4.1 Module Responsibilities
- `prep_samples.py`: Raw data generation and caching
- `models/common/data.py`: PyTorch adapter layer (DataLoaders, tensors)
- `researcher.py`: Overall orchestration and experiment management

### 4.2 Design Patterns Used
- **Adapter Pattern**: data.py adapts raw data to PyTorch format
- **Dependency Injection**: shutdown_event is injected at runtime
- **Factory Methods**: Dynamic creation of cipher samples

## 5. Future Recommendations

### 5.1 Code Structure
- Formalize the interfaces between modules
- Add type annotations to function signatures
- Consider using abstract base classes for core components

### 5.2 Testing
- Add unit tests for data generation pipeline
- Create integration tests for full workflow
- Add regression tests to verify correct data flow

### 5.3 Documentation
- Document data flow and module responsibilities
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between modules
- Add inline comments for complex interactions

The data pipeline is now functional, maintaining the original architecture while resolving the critical issues that were preventing the system from working properly.
